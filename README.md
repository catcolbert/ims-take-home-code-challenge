# IMS Take-Home Code Challenge

This programming challenge will be used to assess your skill level with Blazor Server, ASP.NET 6, C#, HTML/CSS, and problem-solving abilities. We are looking for clean, expressive code that follows object-oriented principles and software development best practices. 

*Download the project template to get started. The solution contains two project templates, one for the Blazor Server webpage and one for the API application. It will be up to you to design any object classes and services to replace the template files. Data is provided in the root of the solution folder: "Dogs For Adoption Data.xlsx"*

## Overview
An imaginary client has requested a single web page to display a grid of dogs available for adoption. This grid should display the dog's name, a picture of the dog, a short description about the dog, and the date it is available for adoption. The grid should be able to sort by the dog's name or the date available for adoption. There should also be a search text box to search for a dog by name within the grid.

## Time Limit:
No longer than 4 hours should be spent on this project. If you get to the 4 hour mark and haven't finished, go ahead and submit your work. You'll have a chance to discuss the challenges you faced and what else you would have done in the code review.

## Requirements:
- Demonstrate use of components within the Blazor Server environment
- Demonstrate use of REST conventions
- Include routes to:
  - Fetch data for the grid
- Responsive layout
  
## Bonuses:
- Include a route to add a dog available for adoption
- Add the ability to search for adoptable dogs within a date range
